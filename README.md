# Project Overview
* Led a project on stock market analysis and prediction using Python and Random Forest classifiers, aiming to forecast market trends and identify profitable investment opportunities.
* Collected and preprocessed historical stock market data, including price, volume, and technical indicators, to prepare it for model training.
* Developed Random Forest classifier models using Scikit-learn to predict stock price movements and classify market trends with high accuracy.Evaluated the model performance using appropriate metrics.

### Project Steps
* Download data using the yfinance package
* Create an initial machine learning model and estimate accuracy
* Build a backtesting engine to more accurately measure accuracy
* Improve the accuracy of the model
